You will have heard at this point that Heroku is ending their free tier offerings for deployment with its platform. From November 28th, Heroku will no longer offer free apps or databases to their users. 



THIS EMAIL IS FOR ALUMNI ONLY, IF YOU HAVE RECENTLY GRADUATED AND HAVE ACCESS TO THE GITHUB STUDENT PACK PLEASE DISREGARD.



Here at Code Institute, we know how important it is for you to have all of your portfolio deployed, available online to show off all the hard work you put in during your time on the course.

  

You can opt to remain with Heroku under one of their paid services, or you can migrate your projects to a different free service on an alternative platform. 

Our team has explored alternative free services and found Render to be a suitable option for you.



We have created step by step guides and supporting documentation for migrating your projects to Render. You will find the links to these below, please choose the correct links for the projects you have.
